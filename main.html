<h1>understanding Time,Space,Complexity</h1>   
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. It is crucial for determining how efficient an algorithm is, especially as the size of the input grows. By analyzing time complexity, we can predict the performance and scalability of an algorithm in different scenarios.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run as a function of the size of the input. Just like time complexity, space complexity is expressed in Big O notation, such as <b>O(n)</b>, where 'n' is the size of the input. Understanding space complexity helps in assessing whether an algorithm can run efficiently within the constraints of available memory.</p><script type="text/javascript" src="./script.js">
